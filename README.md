# cs_review, a place to review your computer science stuff

## Note! I am just getting started, so these are all placeholders for the time being

## Motivation

Hi, I'm Pete. I made this repository to organize my thoughts and review materials related to computer science. I wanted an easily searchable place where I could get answers to common CS questions and even include example code that I've written myself in order to really hammer in the knowledge. Each folder represents an area of CS and inside of each folder you will find an `overview.md` as well as other markdown files on the various topics.

If this is helpful for anyone else that would be great! Thanks for stopping by!
